	"content": "the article that stuck out most from the readings for me was Olia Lialina's \"Vernacular Web 2\".  sixteen years later, the site's  design still feels modern, while basically none of its predictions have come true. i don't really remember a web before social media platforms became where most things happen online and everyone keeps a computer in their pocket. Lialina writes about a web \"intertwined with our daily lives\", she's referring to a web before elections are decided by a candidate's twitter presence, mass shootings are planned on forums and livestreamed, cops are held accountable with cellphone footage, and a handful of companies control the entire web by selling the private data of billions. and a web before apps! \n i think also that the amateur user of 2007 and of 2023 are very different people. or, the amateur user Lialina describes can't really exist anymore. in 2007, an amateur user making a homepage knows more about how the internet works than any amateur today. that person today is either a young child or a senior, and their web experience is moderated by a handful of platforms. maybe they watch youtube, talk to friends on whatsapp, and read the news on facebook. it's likely that they will never leave these platforms to make their own homepage, and the platforms they're on have long removed user customization. there's really no practical reason to learn how to design a site when you can have your voice heard by all your followers on social media. Someone today who makes their own homepage needs to have the extra motivation to break out of the default platforms. They're by necessity an amateur web developer, rather than an amateur user. The web amateurs of the past are the developers and designers of the present. (or maybe they're not i just like the idea lol)"
